# BMI trends in cystic fibrosis

Objectives (taken from the data request form):

1.	To describe the trend in BMI/BMI percentile of the UK cystic fibrosis population over the period 2007-2023, by summarizing the BMI/BMI percentiles distribution each year and by summarizing  the proportions of people classed as; underweight - BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 (adults) or <5th percentile (children) , healthy weight- BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m2 (adults) or 5th–<85th percentile (children), overweight - BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2 (adults) or 85th-94.9th percentile (children), and obese - BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (adults) or  ≥95th percentile (children) and obese each year. This analysis will be done in:

	a. The adult CF population > 18 years of age
	b. The paediatric CF population 2 years to 17 years and 11 months of age
	c. Subgroups of the CF population defined by CFTR modulator use

1. To describe the cross-sectional association between demographic/clinical factors and BMI/BMI percentile. Factors of interest include: sex, age, genotype, ethnicity, pancreatic status, diabetes status, age of diagnosis, lung function, socioeconomic status, exacerbation frequency and microbiology treatment. This analysis will be done separately in subgroups of the CF population, defined by CFTR modulator use

Objective 1
Trends in BMI/BMI percentile   over time will be investigated by estimating the proportion of individuals with CF who were classified as underweight, healthy weight, overweight and obese each year in the period 2007-2023. For each weight group, in each year, the count, proportion, and corresponding 95% confidence interval will be calculated. This analysis will include all people with CF over 2 years of age in the CF Registry with BMI/BMI percentile recorded at least one clinical review visit between 2007-2023. Results will be presented graphically to illustrate changes in BMI/BMI percentile  trends over time. We will also summarise the BMI/BMI percentile  distribution (as a continuous variable) using:
* Tabular summaries of means (SDs) by year
* Graphical displays (e.g., smoothed histograms) by year
This analysis will be done in the entire CF population. Paediatric and adults will be analysed separately, and by subgroups defined by CFTR modulator use. We define five subgroups: pre-modulator era (2007-2012); ivacaftor era, ivacaftor users (2013-2023); ivacaftor era, ivacaftor non-users (2013-2023); kaftrio era, kaftrio users (2020-2023); kaftrio era, kaftrio non-users (2020-2023). Ivacaftor users will be excluded from the kaftrio era; symkevi and orkambi users will be excluded from the ivacaftor and kaftrio eras. 

Objective 2

The association between BMI/BMI percentile  and individual characteristics (i.e., those listed in objective 2) will be assessed using linear regression models. We will include all individuals with at least one clinical review visit between 2007-2023. 

For each characteristic of interest, we will define a model with BMI/BMI percentile  as the outcome and the individual characteristic as a predictor. These models will provide an estimate of the expected association between BMI/BMI percentile  and the individual characteristic. For example, a model with lung function as a predictor will give an estimate of the expected increase (or decrease) in BMI/BMI percentile associated with an increase in lung function; a model with genotype as a predictor will give an estimate of the expected differences in BMI/BMI percentile  between people with different genotypes. Unadjusted associations will be explored first (i.e., using a simple linear regression model including only the predictor of interest); we will then consider adjusted associations with adjustment for age, sex and calendar year. 

For both objectives, children and adults will be analysed separately.
